# Comparative Metrics Framework (cmf) in R to evaluate the performance of synthetic data. 

cmf provides the Ratio of Counts(ROC) function and the Differential Correct Attribution Probability(DCAP). 

These functions along with other metrics, are used to construct a systematic and comprehensive framework in evaluating the quality of synthetic datasets and different synthesis methods. 

For more details, please refer to [Comparative Metrics Framework in R to evaluate the performance of Synthetic Data](comparative metrics framework.pdf)
